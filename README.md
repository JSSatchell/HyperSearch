# HyperSearch
Instant internet search, minus the distractions.

This is a WIP of a utility that will let you search the internet for text that is highlighted or input, as well as store favorite URLs in an easy to navigate and search list.

HyperSearch Lite is currently a functioning simple version that uses the hotkey Win + Spacebar to open a text box to search the internet as well as Ctrl + Win + Spacebar to search the internet for any highlighted text. There are also five quick-access link buttons.
