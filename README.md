#### OVERVIEW

**Preview:**

HyperSearch is a minimalist bookmark managing utility that focuses on speed and distraction-free access to what you're searching for.

It provides customizable hotkeys for searching any highlighted text as well as a search bar that can search both the internet and your personal index of link categories.

HyperSearch Lite is a streamlined version of the searchbar and favorites without the bookmark manager.

**Preview:**

#### GENERAL USAGE 

Open the GUI with `Win`+`Space` or search any highlighted text with `Ctrl`+`Win`+`Space`. (These hotkeys can be reconfigured to user preference.)

Close the GUI with `Escape` or `Close Window` from the `X` menu.

The app will stay open in the system tray unless closed from the tray or via `Exit App` from the `X` menu.

When the app is launched for the first time it will create `HS_Settings.ini` and `HSR_Master.csv` sidecar files. If the .exe is moved the .ini and .csv files must stay in the same root folder as the .exe or the settings will be reset. Do not rename these files or new ones will be created the next time the app is launched and the app will be reset to it's default configuration.

#### NAVIGATION

Navigate the favorites menu easily with `Alt`+`1` - `9` or `Alt`+`X` for the exit menu.

Type in the search bar and press enter to search the internet via your default search engine (see changing the default search engine below)

Type a `Space` at the beginning of your search to search the index on the left instead

    _Category Name
    
If the search starts with a `Space`, pressing `Enter` will set the focus to the links window below the search bar. Pressing `Enter` again will activate the highlighted link.

Type a `#` followed by a number to highlight the link in the specified position.

    #10

Type `#v` to highlight the last link in the current category.

    #v

`Alt`+`A` and `Alt`+`D` will also toggle between the two listboxes, skipping the search bar.

If one of the listboxes is active, `Alt`+`W` and `Alt`+`S` will toggle the slection up and down, respectively.

If the search bar is active, `Alt`+`S` or `Alt`+`W` will activate the links window and start cycling down through the links.

Also with the search bar active, `Alt`+`Q` will clear all of the current text so a new search can be started more quickly.

#### LOAD & IMPORT

To load a repository other than the default HSR_Master.csv file, type `Load>` followed by the pathname of a .csv file that is formatted consistently with HyperSearch. If the file is in the same folder as the HyperSearch executable, only the filename need be typed.

    Load>C:\Users\username\Documents\HyperSearch\Repositories\MyCustomRepository.csv
    
To import bookmarks from Google Chrome, type `Import>` followed by the pathname of a .html file that has been generated by the "Export Bookmarks" function of Google Chrome. If the file is in the same folder as the HyperSearch executable, only the filename need be typed (with .html extension and case-sensitive spelling).

    Import>C:\Users\username\Documents\HyperSearch\Imports\bookmarks_m_d_yyyy.html
    
_NOTE: When importing from Chrome you will have the option to add the bookmarks to the exisiting repository or replace the existing repository with the bookmarks. If you choose to replace the existing repository all links will be permanently deleted. It is recommended to make a copy of the existing repository before choosing to replace it._
    
To import a HyperSearch category or full HyperSearch repository, type `Import>` followed by the pathname of a .csv file that is formatted consistently with HyperSearch. If the file is in the same folder as the HyperSearch executable, only the filename need be typed (with .csv extension and case-sensitive spelling).

    Import>C:\Users\username\Documents\HyperSearch\Imports\SharedLinks.csv

When importing a .csv, all links will be added to the current repository.

_NOTE: When adding new categories via .csv if any imported category has the same name as an existing category, the links from the new category will not be visible. To get around this, rename the exisiting category before or after the import and the new category and its corresponding links will be revealed._

To create a new repository with the default categories, type `New>` followed by the desired filename or path of the new repository.

    New>HSR_New.csv
    
_NOTE: If the new filename is the same as a file in the specified folder, the existing file will be loaded. If no filename is provided, the default name "HSR_Master.csv" will be used. If "HSR_Master.csv" already exists, it will be loaded._
