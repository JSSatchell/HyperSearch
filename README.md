# HyperSearch
Instant internet search, minus the distractions

This is a WIP of a utility that will let you search the internet for text that is highlighted or input, as well as store favorite URLs in an easy to navigate and search list.

HyperSearch Lite is currently a functioning simple version that opens a text box to search the internet and allows for four quick access favorite links.
