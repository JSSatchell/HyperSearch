**GENERAL USAGE:**

Open the search bar with Win + Space or search any highlighted text with Ctrl + Win + Space.

Navigate the favorites menu easily with Alt + 1-9 or Alt + X for the exit menu.

The app will stay open in the system tray unless closed from the tray or via "Exit App" from the "X" menu.

When the app is launched for the first time it will create a .ini sidecar file. If the .exe is moved the .ini must stay in the same root folder or the settings will be reset.

**UPDATE FAVORITES**

To update favorites type a number 1-9 and then ">" followed by your desired label name then ">" followed by the link URL. For example:
 
    1>GMail>mail.google.com
    
To clear a selection type the number of the favorite followed by only ">"

    1>
   
To set a new label for a favorite, simple omit the last ">"

    1>GMail

To set a new link for an existing favorite without updating the label, use ">>"

    1>>drive.google.com
